{
  "course": "Math 23A – Vector Calculus",
  "concept_summary": "This course covers fundamental concepts of vector calculus including vectors in n-dimensional space, inner and cross products, matrix representation of linear transformations, paths and arc lengths in 3D, Taylor's theorem, constrained extrema with Lagrange multipliers, and applications of the implicit function theorem. Students will learn to work with vector fields, divergence, curl, and multiple constraints in real-world contexts.",
  "practice_problems": [
    {
      "question": "Given two vectors A = [2, 3, 1] and B = [4, -1, 2], compute their dot product.",
      "answer": "The dot product of A and B is calculated as A · B = (2)(4) + (3)(-1) + (1)(2) = 8 - 3 + 2 = 7."
    },
    {
      "question": "Calculate the cross product of A = [2, 3, 1] and B = [4, -1, 2].",
      "answer": "The cross product of A and B is given by A × B = [(3*2 - 1*-1), (1*4 - 2*2), (2*-1 - 3*4)] = [6 + 1, 4 - 4, -2 - 12] = [7, 0, -14]."
    },
    {
      "question": "Find the gradient of the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 2).",
      "answer": "The gradient of f(x, y) is ∇f(x, y) = [2x, 2y]. At the point (1, 2), ∇f(1, 2) = [2(1), 2(2)] = [2, 4]."
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the arc length of the curve r(t) = [t, t^2, t^3] from t = 0 to t = 1.",
      "answer": "The arc length is given by L = ∫ from 0 to 1 √(1 + (2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2) dt. This can be simplified and integrated to find the total length, approximately 1.48 units."
    },
    {
      "question": "Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum of f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 subject to the constraint x + y = 1.",
      "answer": "The Lagrange multiplier method gives the system of equations: ∇f = λ∇g. Solving this yields the maximum values at (x, y) = (1/2, 1/2), with a maximum value of 1/2."
    },
    {
      "question": "Find the divergence and curl of the vector field F(x, y, z) = [x^2, y^2, z^2].",
      "answer": "The divergence of F is div(F) = ∂/∂x(x^2) + ∂/∂y(y^2) + ∂/∂z(z^2) = 2x + 2y + 2z. The curl of F is curl(F) = ∇ × F = [0, 0, 0], as each component is a function of a single variable."

Syllabus prompt - Takes a syllabus in the form of a string and outputs a json file 

-----AI prompt-----: "You are an expert in structuring educational data and designing course study aids. Given a university-level math course description, generate a comprehensive JSON object that includes the following fields as a json file of 5 items course_name: "course name" | concepts: "all concepts separated by commas" | keywords : "keywords separated by commas" | important_dates: "description of the class followed by the date mm/dd/yyyy excluding the time": concepts: A list of all distinct core mathematical concepts covered in the course. keywords: A comma-separated list of important keywords from the syllabus. important_dates: A list of all major course events (e.g., exams, section start dates) with a description, date mm/dd/yyyy problems: A list of conceptual problems derived from all the concepts above. There should be one unique problem per concept. Each problem object should include a concept title mentioned earlier, a problem, and an answer: concept: The concept this problem relates to. problem: A concise, original, and clear problem statement that requires understanding of the concept. answer: A brief but accurate explanation or solution to the problem. Avoid latex format. Now extract this data as a json file."
